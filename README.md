# Sprint2
all files and photos used for the HTML, CSS etc are in the ZIP file for more reference

The link for the Playlist for Sprint 2 is here:

          Lastly, I would just like to apologize for a long video on CSS and Scrum as I've been explaining my points in them
          
          
# Edit: will not change HTML, CSS, and JS files for Sprint 2 as this is how they looked like before I implemented the Django framework for Sprint3
